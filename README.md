## Cisco DevNet Learning Labs: 

These self-paced interactive tutorials provide instructions for developers to .... 

Labs are written to be displayed within the [Cisco DevNet Learning Labs system](https://learninglabs.cisco.com).

Contributions are welcome, and we are glad to review changes through pull requests. See [contributing.md](contributing.md) for details.

Once approved, create a release that we use to publish in our Learning Labs system. 

The goal of these learning labs is to ensure a 'hands-on' learning approach rather than just theory or instructions.

## About these Learning Labs

For your repository, answer these questions: 
* What does this set of learning lab do?
* Why is this set of learning lab useful?
* How do I get started?
* Where can I get more help, if I need it?

## Contributing

Note that contributions to these learning modules are for public consumption, so you must ensure you have the rights to provide any contributed content.

Write your content in Markdown, and your wording and syntax is reviewed according to the [Cisco Style Guide](http://www-author.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/general/style/guide/Latest/stylegd.html). (Link available on Cisco VPN only.)

#### Publishing Requirements

To create and publish a new lab, you must:
- Add a new folder under labs
- Create a JSON file with the same name as the labs/folder name
- Create markdown files named 1.md, 2.md, and so on, and refer to those files in the JSON file
- Ensure the JSON file contains page titles in addition to file references
- Send a pull request, then get the files commited and merged to `master` by a DevNet reviewer

A DevNet reviewer then creates a release on the repository with the latest `master` and publishes through the admin interface.

#### Editors

You can write Markdown in a plain text editor but there are many desktop and web-based options which allow you to write and preview your work at the same time. We recommend Visual Studio Code [Download](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for a few reasons:
- Lightweight environment for coding (or writing Markdown)
- Available on MAC, Linux or Windows
- Github Client integration
- Great Markdown preview features native in the editor
- Intuitive operation and structure

You can validate a JSON file by using the [online formatter and validator](https://jsonformatter.curiousconcept.com).
