# How to contribute to a Learning Lab

For Learning Labs, there are a few primary ways to help:
 - Testing the Learning Lab and then reporting issues in the repo or in the common issues tracking repo
 - Using the Issue tracker to report issues or comment that you will work on an issue
 - Updating the content in the Learning Lab repo
 - Requesting or creating a release
 - Contacting DevNet to publish new or updated Learning Labs

## Using the issue tracker

For Learning Labs, there are two potential places to track issues, depending on
whether the repo is a public or private repo.

For public repo Learning Labs, use the issue tracker in the repo. All Learning Labs repos in the CiscoDevNet organization have a topic of `learning-labs`.

For private Learning Labs, use the common Issue tracker in the [CiscoDevNet/learning-labs-issues](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/learning-labs-issues) repo.

For DevNet Express events, use these three Issue tracker repos based on the content track:
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-dna-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-cc-issues
* https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-express-dci-issues

Use the issue tracker to suggest additions, report bugs, and ask questions.
This is also a great way to connect with the developers of the project as well
as others who are interested in this solution.

Also use the issue tracker to find ways to contribute. Test a lab, find a bug,
log an issue, or offer an update, comment on the issue that you will take on
that effort, then follow the _Changing the Learning Lab content_ guidance below.

## Changing the Learning Lab content

Generally speaking, you should fork the Learning Lab repository, make changes in
your fork, and then submit a pull request (PR). All new content should be tested
to validate that documented tasks work correctly. Additionally, the content
should follow the [Learning Lab Style Guide](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki/Lab-Style-Guide).

The [DevNet Writing Guidelines Wiki](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/devnet-writing-guidelines/wiki)
describes the review and publishing process in detail. Please feel free to request reviews from DevNet contributors you see in the repository and we will review submissions.
